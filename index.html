				<p>Hey, I’m</p>

					<p>
						With nearly a decade of professional experience, I am a developer specializing in PHP,
						JavaScript, and Python, with a passion for C++ and Go. As a freelancer, I am dedicated to
						delivering high-quality software and continuously expanding my skills, a journey I often
						document in my blogs. You can review my professional work in the experience section.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Currently, I am deepening my expertise by pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Systems and
						Networks at the Warsaw University of Technology. In my free time, I enjoy building C++ tools to
						understand how software is made and developing IoT solutions to automate my home, I also share
						these projects on my Github or in the projects section.
