							<p>
								Radio signal congestion in Wi-Fi networks is becoming a critical issue as current
								channel selection methods struggle to keep up with demand. A novel solution utilizes
								neural networks to "listen" to the frequency spectrum and intelligently identify the
								best available channels for data transmission. This approach, particularly when using a
								Convolutional Support Vector Machine, has demonstrated over 90% accuracy in optimizing
								wireless connectivity and reducing interference.
